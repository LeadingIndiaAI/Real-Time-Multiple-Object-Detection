# Real_time_Object_detection_TF
We worked on a project based on Deep Learning and we are able to detect objects through an image, a video and real-time(web cam and cellphone camera)

This is an implementation of tensor flow object detection API for running it in Real time through Webcam and cellphone camera.

The video for the same is at :

Download the object_recognition_detection.zip

For running the object detection on image files run the object_detection_tutorial.py

For running the object detection in realtime with web camera run the object_detection_webcam.py

For running the object detection in realtime with cellphone camera run the object_detection_phone.py

The official tensorflow object detection API link is https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection
